This project is the site of a certain Robin W, an Italian product designer.
The site has sections:
- Robin's work experience;
- his philosophy and values;
- skill set;
- portfolio;
- links to social networks;

Also there are javascript tabs and hover-effects on the site.

The site is cross-browser.
